There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.


  

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
Party people who like music and don't like bad music and are community minded and
love a shared music experience - aka a collective listening experience.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

Create a music experience where everyone is sharing the role of dj. Allows users to
submit song suggestions and allow others to vote on the song selection to move it
up in the queue. The highest rated song is next in queue to get play. Allowed users
to choose songs in a collective playlist. And ever-changing listening experience
powered by party people. The pain point is everyone wanting to be the dj at every
gathering they're at (wedding, party, any social gathering).  Great for road trips. 




## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

Everyone at a party has a song they want to play. Our app lets you do that without
horning in on the host's computer, phone, or stereo. Anywhere where people play
music. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

It's a simple interface that allows people to quickly and easily participate in a
music-listening experience. You can collaborate as easily as you can find your song
on Soundcloud.  Profiles could let you see who put up what song and who voted for
it. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  > ProductName opens up the music-sharing experience, allowing everyone with you
  to take part in sharing, discovering, and connecting through music. 


## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

Just register a room and pass the url out to everyone you want to share with. Then
it's as easy as selecting songs on SoundCloud. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

I went to a party and everyone got to choose tracks to play. It was awesome! I
ended up using it on my road trip. It's the best way to let you and your friends
curate music together and learn about the music your friends are into. 

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
